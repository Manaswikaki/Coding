## Easy
Given two numbers&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b. You need to perform basic mathematical operations on them. You will be provided an integer named as operator. 

If the operator equals to 1&nbsp;add&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b, then print the result.
If the operator equals to 2&nbsp;subtract&nbsp;b&nbsp;from&nbsp;a,&nbsp;then&nbsp;print the result.
If the operator equals to 3&nbsp;multiply&nbsp;a&nbsp;and&nbsp;b,&nbsp;then&nbsp;print the result.
If the operator equals to any other number, print "Invalid Input"(without quotes).

Note: Do not add a new line at the end.
Examples:
Input: a = 1, b = 2, operator = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 * 2 = 2
Input: a = 2, b = 2, operator = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 - 2 = 0
