## Easy
You are given a number&nbsp;a and you have to print your answer according to the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, you print&nbsp;"Fizz"&nbsp;(without quotes)
If the number is divisible by 5, you print&nbsp;"Buzz"&nbsp;(without quotes)
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print&nbsp;"FizzBuzz"&nbsp;(without quotes)
In any other case, you print the number itself

Note:&nbsp;You should add a&nbsp;new-line&nbsp;character after print statement.
