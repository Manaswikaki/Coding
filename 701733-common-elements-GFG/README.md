## Easy
Given two integer arrays a[] and b[]. Return the list of elements common to both the lists and return the list in sorted order. Duplicates may be there in the output list.
Example:
Input: a[] = [3, 4, 2, 2, 4] , b[] = [3, 2, 2, 7]
Output: 2 2 3
Explanation: The common elements in sorted order are [2, 2, 3]
Input: a[] = [3, 6, 1, 7, 9, 8, 2, 2] , b[] = [9, 7, 3, 4, 9]Output: 3 7 9Explanation: The common elements in sorted order are [3, 7, 9]
Constraints:
1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 105
